## 4a - Describe when to use `terraform import` to import existing infrastructure into your Terraform state

Use `terraform import` when you want Terraform to manage resources that have already been deployed.  

***Note***: *Be careful to import each remote object to only one Terraform resource address.*  

### Importing externally-created objects with `terraform import`  

First write a resource block for it in your configuration, establishing the name by which it will be known to Terraform:  

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  # ...instance configuration...
}
```

Now `terraform import` can be run to attach an existing instance to this resource configuration:   

```console
terraform import aws_vpc.import vpc-05483b423b9e04565 
```
```terraform
aws_vpc.import: Importing from ID "vpc-05483b423b9e04565"...
aws_vpc.import: Import prepared!
  Prepared aws_vpc for import
aws_vpc.import: Refreshing state... [id=vpc-05483b423b9e04565]

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
```

```console
terraform state list                                 
```
```terraform
aws_instance.my-instance
aws_vpc.import
```


Terraform can generate code for the resources you define in import blocks that do not already exist in your configuration. 
https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import/generating-configuration

`import.tf`
```hcl
import {
  to = aws_vpc.import
  id = "vpc-05483b423b9e04565"
}
```

```console
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf
```
```terraform
aws_vpc.import: Preparing import... [id=vpc-05483b423b9e04565]
aws_vpc.import: Refreshing state... [id=vpc-05483b423b9e04565]
```

Rendered `generated.tf` file:
```hcl
# __generated__ by Terraform
# Please review these resources and move them into your main configuration files.

# __generated__ by Terraform
resource "aws_vpc" "import" {
  assign_generated_ipv6_cidr_block     = false
  cidr_block                           = "10.0.0.0/24"
  enable_dns_hostnames                 = false
  enable_dns_support                   = true
  enable_network_address_usage_metrics = false
  instance_tenancy                     = "default"
  ipv4_ipam_pool_id                    = null
  ipv4_netmask_length                  = null
  ipv6_cidr_block                      = null
  ipv6_cidr_block_network_border_group = null
  ipv6_ipam_pool_id                    = null
  ipv6_netmask_length                  = 0
  tags = {
    Name = "new_vpc_created_from_aws_ui"
  }
  tags_all = {
    Name = "new_vpc_created_from_aws_ui"
  }
}
```

---  

## 4b - Use `terraform state` to view Terraform state

To list resources within a Terraform state.

```console
terraform state list
```
```terraform 
aws_instance.foo
aws_instance.bar[0]
aws_instance.bar[1]
module.elb.aws_elb.main
```

Filtering by Resource  

```console
terraform state list aws_instance.bar
```
```terraform 
aws_instance.bar[0]
aws_instance.bar[1]
```

Filtering by Module  

```console
terraform state list module.elb
```
```terraform 
module.elb.aws_elb.main
module.elb.module.secgroups.aws_security_group.sg
```

### Terraform State Show  

To provide human-readable output from a state or plan file. 

```console
terraform state show module.vpc.aws_subnet.this
```
```terraform 
resource "aws_subnet" "this" {
    arn                                            = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:312939059436:subnet/subnet-0ea5b69336332dd6e"
    assign_ipv6_address_on_creation                = false
    availability_zone                              = "us-east-1f"
    availability_zone_id                           = "use1-az5"
    cidr_block                                     = "10.0.1.0/24"
    enable_dns64                                   = false
    enable_lni_at_device_index                     = 0
    enable_resource_name_dns_a_record_on_launch    = false
    enable_resource_name_dns_aaaa_record_on_launch = false
    id                                             = "subnet-0ea5b69336332dd6e"
    ipv6_native                                    = false
    map_customer_owned_ip_on_launch                = false
    map_public_ip_on_launch                        = false
    owner_id                                       = "312939059436"
    private_dns_hostname_type_on_launch            = "ip-name"
    tags_all                                       = {}
    vpc_id                                         = "vpc-00d73267a5b1af622"
}
```

### Terraform State Outputs  

Extract the value of an output variable from the state file.

`outputs.tf` file:
```hcl
output "instance_ips" {
  value = aws_instance.web.*.public_ip
}

output "lb_address" {
  value = aws_alb.web.public_dns
}

output "password" {
  sensitive = true
  value     = var.secret_password
}
```

```console
terraform output
```
```terraform
instance_ips = [
  "54.43.114.12",
  "52.122.13.4",
  "52.4.116.53"
]
lb_address = "my-app-alb-1657023003.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
password = <sensitive>


```console
terraform output instance_ips
```
```terraform
instance_ips = [
  "54.43.114.12",
  "52.122.13.4",
  "52.4.116.53"
]
```

```console
terraform output lb_address
```
```terraform
"my-app-alb-1657023003.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
```

## 4c - Describe when to enable verbose logging and what the outcome/value is

Environment variables
- `TF_LOG`
  - Enabling this setting causes detailed logs to appear on `stderr`.
  - Debug levels (in order of verbosity):
    - `OFF`
    - `ERROR`
    - `WARN`
    - `INFO`
    - `DEBUG`
    - `TRACE`
- `TF_LOG_PATH`
  - storing logs to a local file (persistant storage instead of `stderr`)


```console
export TF_LOG=INFO
```

```console
terraform init
```

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
